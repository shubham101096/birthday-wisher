# birthday-wisher
This python progran helps in automating the birthday wishes to our friends so that we do not forget to wish them.
There are 3 pre-written birthday letters. List of friends and their birthday date are stored in a csv file. The main.py file can be run on the cloud (e.g python anywhere) once everyday. It checks if a friend has birthday that day and send him an email by randomly picking up a birthday letter from list and adding his name in the greeting. 
It is done with help of pandas and smtplib libraries.

Sample birthday wish sent to friend:
